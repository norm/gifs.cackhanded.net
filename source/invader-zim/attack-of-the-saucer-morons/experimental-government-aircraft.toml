Gir, inside a robot styled to look like a man dressed in a black suit
wearing dark glasses, and with an earpiece, tells the crowd of Saucer
Morons that “This is not an alien lifeform, he is an experimental
government aircraft”.

Desmond is not convinced, “That’s an aircraft?”

Zim yells at the crowd “FOOLS!” and asks “What else would I be?”
