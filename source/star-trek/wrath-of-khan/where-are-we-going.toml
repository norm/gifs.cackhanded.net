McCoy asks Kirk as they are about to beam into Regula One ”Go? Where are we going?”

Kirk gestures at the control panel, as Saavik is setting up the transport.
“Where they went.”
McCoy doesn’t seem convinced. “Suppose they went nowhere?”
“Then this’ll be your big chance to get away from it all.”

McCoy steps onto the transporter pad giving Kirk some serious side-eye.
