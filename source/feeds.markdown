This site makes its content available by Atom feeds. If you don't know
what a feed is, or why you'd care about one, [start here][feeds].

[feeds]: https://aboutfeeds.com


There is the site's main feed, published at [`/index.atom`][firehose], if you
want to know about each and every new GIF published.

If you are more selective, every major source of GIF comes with a feed too, so
you can subscribe to just that. Be it:

* an old sci-fi TV show — [`/babylon-5/index.atom`][b5]
* a modern heartwarming comedy TV show — [`/ted-lasso/index.atom`][tl]
* a classic Disney movie — [`/lilo-and-stitch/index.atom`][ls]
* a YouTube video — [`/shatner-of-the-mount/index.atom`][sm]

[firehose]: /index.atom
[b5]: /babylon-5/index.atom
[tl]: /ted-lasso/index.atom
[ls]: /lilo-and-stitch/index.atom
[sm]: /shatner-of-the-mount/index.atom

And every tag applied to a GIF comes with a feed, so you can subscribe
to that subset too:

* you are only interested in Invader Zim GIFs that feature the
  Almighty Tallest Purple character —
  [`/tags/almighty-tallest-purple/index.atom`][atp]
* you (like me) are obsessed with whiteboards —
  [`/tags/whiteboard/index.atom`][wb]

[atp]: /tags/almighty-tallest-purple/index.atom
[wb]: /tags/whiteboard/index.atom

Look for the "feed" links in the source and tags pages, or in the footer
across the site.
