I like to noodle about making GIFs. Many are going to be from 
[Invader Zim](/invader-zim/).

You are free to link to them or copy them. But I would prefer that you link,
because The Internet Works That Way.

If you have any requests, then feel free to ask me via
[twitter](https://twitter.com/cackhanded). I might even honour the request one
day. Or, if you know how and can be bothered, issue a pull request with
the suggested configuration for a new GIF.


## Colophon

The GIFs are all created using FFmpeg and some python to create captions.

The site is generated by [flourish](https://github.com/norm/flourish),
uploaded to and hosted from, Amazon S3.

The source and more information can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/norm/gifs.cackhanded.net).
