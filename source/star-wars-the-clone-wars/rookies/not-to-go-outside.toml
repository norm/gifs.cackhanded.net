The clones Cutup, Echo, Hevy, and Fives are exploring the Rishi moon. A Rishi
Eel grabs Cutup in it’s jaws and slides away. Hevy takes a couple of shots at
it, then turns to the others and shouts “What the hell was that?!”

Echo states “That was an eel. Now, now, that’s why we have the regulation not
to go outside.”
